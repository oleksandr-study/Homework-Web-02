## Save Data

The chat bot program uses two binary files to store the contacts and notes data: `addressbook.bin` and `notes.bin`. The program uses the `book` and `notes` related data to read and write the data from and to the files. The program read and loads data from binary files at the beginning of the chat bot working. The program also write data to the binary files after every command that modifies the data to save the changes to the files. The program uses binary files because they are faster and more efficient than text files.
